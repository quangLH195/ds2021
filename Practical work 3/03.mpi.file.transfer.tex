\section{Why choose MPI implementation ?}
I choose openMPI to install beacause it's easy to installation.
\begin{itemize}
    \item First, we install OpenMPI by command "sudo apt install libopenmpi-dev"
    \item Second, we compile the MPI by command "mpicc <c-file> -o <file-name>
    \item Third, we run MPI by command "mpirun -np <number of processes> <file-name>
\end{itemize}

\section{Design MPI service}
\begin{itemize}
\item The system has a root and a number of process. 
\item User can send different file to each child process.
\item The root process check the user input to see whether the file is valid
\item The root process can sends the title and the content of the file separately to the child process using for loop through each child
\end{itemize}
\section{Organize the system}
